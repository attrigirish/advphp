static variable

Key Points:
- The value of a static variable can be commonly shared by all the instances of a class.
- A static variable is declared in the memory as soos as a program starts.
- A static variable cannot be accessed without creating any object of a class. You can access the static variables with the class name itself.
- A static variable remains in the memory for as long as the program is in execution.
