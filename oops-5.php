//Constructors and Destructors

/*
A destructor is a special member function which is used to de-initialize the data members of a class. 
A destructor is the last function which gets called in the life cycle of an object. 
Key Points:

1. Destructor function cannot be called explicitly.
2. A destructor function gets called when an object is terminated.
3. A destructor function can be created with __destruct.
4. A destructor function is parameterless.
5. A destructor function cannot return any value.
