//Constructors and Destructors

/*
A constructor is a special member function which is used to initialize the data members of a class. A constructor is also called an initializer function. 
A constructor function gets called everytime a new object of a class is created.

Key Points:

1. Constructor function cannot be called explicitly.
2. A constructor function gets called when an object is created of a class.
3. A constructor function can be created with __construct.
4. A constructor function can be parameterized or parameterless.
5. A constructor function cannot return any value.
