Laravel Storages

1. Public Storage

storage\app\public


The public storage is intended for files that are going to be publicly accessible. By default, the public files are stored storage/app/public. 

To make them accessible from the web, you should create a symbolic link from public/storage to storage/app/public. 

To create symbolic use the following command:

>php artisan storage:link




2. Local Storage

storage\app

When using the local driver, all file operations are relative to the root directory defined in your filesystems configuration file. 

By default, this value is set to the storage/app directory. 


3. Cloud Storage

Cloud Storage lets you write files on to the cloud server.

Before using the SFTP, S3, or Rackspace drivers, you will need to install the appropriate package via Composer:

    SFTP: league/flysystem-sftp ~1.0
    Amazon S3: league/flysystem-aws-s3-v3 ~1.0
    Rackspace: league/flysystem-rackspace ~1.0




Saving Files in Laravel using Storage Facade
--------------------------------------------

e.g.

Storage::disk('local')->put('file.txt', 'Contents');

Storage::disk('s3')->put('avatars/1', $fileContents);



Reading Files from Laravel Storage

e.g.

$contents = Storage::get('file.jpg');


Checking if a particula file exists.

e.g.

$exists = Storage::disk('s3')->exists('file.jpg');


Downloading Files

return Storage::download('file.jpg');

return Storage::download('file.jpg', $name, $headers);


File URLS

$url = Storage::url('file.jpg');


Uploading Files

$path = $request->file('photo')->store('uploads','public');

Note: By default 'store' function uploads the file(s) with an arbitrary name. To upload files with specific names use 'storeAs' function.


$path = $request->file('photo')->storeAs('uploads','filename.jpg','public');
